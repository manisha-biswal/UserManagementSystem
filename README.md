## Frameworks and Language Used
- **Framework:** Spring Boot
- **Language:** Java
- **Build Tool:** Maven

 

## Data Flow

 

### Controller
- Responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and delegating to services.
- Defines API endpoints for various operations (e.g., adding a user, updating user information, deleting a user).

 

### Services
- Implements the business logic and processes data.
- Validates input data and interacts with the repository for database operations.
- Handles data transformations and interactions with external systems (if applicable).

 

### Repository
- Manages data access to the database.
- Performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data.
- May include data mapping and conversion between Java objects and database entities.

 

### Database Design
- Describes the structure and relationships of the database tables.
- Typically includes tables for users, with fields such as `userId`, `userName`, `userEmail`, `userContactNo`, `dob`, and timestamps.

 

## Data Structures Used in Your Project
- **User Class:** Defines the structure for user data.
- **Type Enum:** Enumerates user types (ADMIN, INTERNAL, EXTERNAL).
- **ArrayList:** Used to store and manage lists of User objects in various parts of the application.

 

## Project Summary
The project, named "User Management," is a Spring Boot application for managing user data.
- It provides RESTful API endpoints for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting user information.
- Users can be categorized into different types (ADMIN, INTERNAL, EXTERNAL).
- The application uses Java for the backend and Maven for build management.
- It follows a layered architecture with controllers, services, and repositories for clean code separation.
- Data validation and error handling are implemented to ensure data integrity and reliability.
- The project aims to demonstrate validation, RESTful API development, and database interaction using Spring Boot.
